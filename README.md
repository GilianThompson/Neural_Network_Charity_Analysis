### Overview 
Using TensorFlow, design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soupâ€“funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.  

### Results 
## Data Preprocessing 

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
For the neural network, there are two hidden layers. The first has eight neurons and uses the ReLu activation function. The second hidden layer has five neurons and again uses the ReLu activation function. The output layer uses the Sigmoid activation function because of the classification problem we're trying to solve; whether or not a charity is worth funding due to the many features provided in the dataset.

## Optimization
The model was optimized in the file AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%
